title: part two: the arrival
summary: I recalled our arrival in Melbourne.
---

it's 3am and i'm encoding ani's latest album, and trying to remember everything we've done recently. even though it's only been about a week, it feels like so so so much longer.

we stayed with the lovely holly when we first got down here. thanks for tolerating us (and letting us take over your living room), babe! we got totally drenched on the first day. oops. damn melbourne weather.

we went to see james o'lachlan (i'm sure i've mispelt that), who has happily restored my faith [sic] in comedy.

on the 23rd (the monday), we checked out just two rental properties; one in prahran (too much carpet, old building, weird yellow wall) and a second in south yarra, which we instantly fell for. believe it or not, we were approved the very same day, and moved in the next one. and here we are! our stuff arrived only this afternoon, and we're almost unpacked.

almost.

i've been to a job agency in the city and i've got an interview next tuesday. hectic. i should be able to put some time into this site again soon, never fear.
