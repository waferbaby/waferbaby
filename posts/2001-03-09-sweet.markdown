summary: I planned a dinner for my birthday.
---

tomorrow i will be a year older. i've never made a big deal out of birthdays (what did daniel do for his twenty first? why, he took his friends and went bowling!). so this whole going-to-dinner-with-fifteen-people tomorrow night will no doubt stand out somewhat.

speaking of birthdays, here's my [wishlist;](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/jyjmvlibn9lm/ref=wl_em_to/103-5969318-9902228?add-fav=1) what are you getting me?

i've redesigned the backend for corner, meaning i have to manually re-enter everything. tedious, but necessary, because i have an idea! mwahahaha!

ugh! i don't believe it; i just got spam *on my mobile phone!* kill me now.
