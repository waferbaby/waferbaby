---

samantha knight. there's a name that i've grown up with; the little girl from bondi who vanished, presumed murdered. unsolved. we used to drive past her school (not too far from here) and i'd get a little shiver.

unsolved, that is, until [now;](http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,1734511%255e1702,00.html) fourteen years later and they've arrested someone.

can you feel the closure? i think i just like saying that word. closure. closure. yeah, i'm finished.

tonight we're going to go for thai with ev's friends in newtown. yum. yum yum yum yum yum.

oh, and most amusing: while taking books down to the garage, i found a 300 baud modem buried under cables. mwahahahahahaha.
