title: primal chaos
summary: I half-finished rewriting Corner.
---

the cicadas are in full bloom. loud little fuckers, ain'tcha? (not that i'm implying any cicadas of note would read my site). you'll have to excuse me, as i'm on a jelly bean sugarhigh; i've been singing ['teenage dirtbag'](http://www.wheatus.com/) in an indian accent to poor ev all night (sorry hon).

this is a new paragraph.

i'm about half-way finished redoing corner - it's so fucking tedious. ugh. but it will be worth it in the end (or so i keep telling myself. hah!)
