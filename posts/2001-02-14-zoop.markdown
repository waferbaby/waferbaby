whee!

the zoo is way cool! we started off at [town hall](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/cs_sydney_town_hall.asp) and walked down to [circular quay](http://www.sydney.com.au/quay.htm), and hopped on a ferry.

i won't pretend i didn't feel a bit sea sick, but it was nice. once at the zoo dock, we had to go up this ramp to - wait for it - a cable car. yikes. this i didn't expect. actually it turns out we didn't *have* to, but we just followed everyone else. it wasn't too bad, apart from the whole swaying very high above the zoo part.

animals rock. we saw sleepy and bathing bears, sleeping tigers, sleeping lions (it was a very hot day, y'know?), very very very cool spider monkeys sunning themselves, picking tics off of one another and scratching their asses and groins a whole lot.

what else?

sleeping snow leopards. seals swimming upside down. the cuuuutest gorilla up close to the window, half awake. swimming lil' penguins having a pool party. a one-tusked elephant, and a swaying elephant that used to belong to a circus. they're trying to train him to, uh, not sway.

the zoo is cool. i don't necessarily agree with caging animals, but it's not like it's a tight enclosure, and they get looked after and protected and so on.
