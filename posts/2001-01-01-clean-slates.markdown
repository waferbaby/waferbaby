after two months of sitting in the corner collecting dust, my scanner has suddenly woken up and said aloud (or perhaps just in my coffee-swamped brain) "man, i'm like, so fucking bored. like, i think i'll start working again".

and it does.

who knows - maybe i'll start a new comic! some sort of a hybrid between the wacky and dao styles (you remember them, don't you?)
