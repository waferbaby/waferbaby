(cough)

i'm still here.

i'm on mum's powerbook, bored shitless, lying on a crappy foam matress in an empty room. the removal was sooo sweet today, though; quick, and painless. they loaded everything into one of those huge metal cargo containers you see on ships and trains.

i watched two good videos this afternoon; "ordinary decent criminal", which was really really cool, and stared kevin spacey, who i love. also saw "the fugative"; an oldie but a goodie.

you'll note i'm not linking to anything; this is because i am not only currently bored, but also lazy.

tomorrow night i'm going bowling with jez and renae and mixmaster nick, who has a new girlfriend (ooer). meanwhile ev will be out getting shitfaced with the girls.

i hope this week goes quickly, because while i'm a patient kind of guy, i hate waiting for something like this. plus i want the plane trip over and done with.

heh.
