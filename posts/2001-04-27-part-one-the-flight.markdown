title: part one: the flight
summary: I recalled our flight to Melbourne.

so, where were we last time we spoke? oh, that's right: sydney. so what happened next?

i had a happy enough night-before-the-flight, with my [brother](http://www.segpub.com.au/) and renae sleeping over. so the big morning arrived, and i felt kinda fine, sorta. at least, my nerves didn't start losing touch with reality and setting themselves ablaze until we all met up at the airport.

yikes. flying, ugh.

guess what? i got upgraded to business class! don't ask me how, but i did. only me, not ev - at first. luckily, i bugged the man behind the counter at our gate and he was able to slip her into the seat next to mine. yay!

kurt and big rob were waiting in our gate, which was cool, and we all chatted away (me nervously) while we waited. finally though, our flight was called, our goodbyes said, our family embraced and we were off!

i felt sick on the whole flight, but managed to not vomit at all, which was good. i passed the time by listening to the in-flight radio and trying to sleep. yes, it was only an hour, but it felt so much longer. as it does.

next post: the arrival!
