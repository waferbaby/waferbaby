summary: I booked removalists for the move to Melbourne.

it's all really happening. wow. wow.

the removalists are booked; they're coming next week to whisk away all of our material possessions! i'll be sleeping in my brother's old bed until we leave, and i won't have the computer (my life is over!), so there'll be no updates from next week on, until no-idea-when.

maybe i'll have guest loggers.

i've been running around with my new little toy, dreaming of making lots of cool little documentaries, taking a slew of photos everywhere i go. the cooooooolest part is that [mac os x](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) automagically sees the device when i plug it into its cradle, and lets me grab the photos and movies off it right onto the desktop.

slick.

i'm thinking of allowing for user-submitted brainstorms. interested? got an idea for one right now? let me know.

mmm, i've got a new dao episode half-finished, too.
