title: babel fish
summary: I re-played THHGTTG text adventure game.
---

"a single babel fish shoots out of the slot. it sails across the room and hits 
the dressing gown. the fish slides down the sleeve of the gown and falls to the floor, landing on the towel. a split-second later, a tiny cleaning robot 
whizzes across the floor, grabs the fish, and continues its breakneck pace 
toward a tiny robot panel at the base of the wall. the robot plows into the 
satchel, sending the babel fish flying through the air in a graceful arc 
surrounded by a cloud of junk mail. another robot flies in and begins madly 
collecting the cluttered plume of mail. the babel fish continues its flight, 
landing with a loud "squish" in your ear."
