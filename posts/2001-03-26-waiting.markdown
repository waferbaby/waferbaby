title: waiting
summary: I waited for my copy of Mac OS X and the occupational therapist.

i've moved my computer downstairs so i can keep an eye on nana and still do work. we're both waiting for things: the occupational therapist for nana, to assess her walking, and the delivery of mac os x for me today.

weblogs are kinda boring sometimes, aren't they? but i make no excuses, because you don't actually have to read this. i think.
