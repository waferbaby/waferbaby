title: oosh
summary: We came back from our trip and I redesigned the site, again.

i'm back, with a new design no less. i hope you dig the cut of its jib and all that. i love my little hover states for links.

we had an awesome weekend up the coast. almost a perfectly smooth drive up there, bar one large accident that blocked off the highway. travelling around sidestreets packed with other cars also being diverted around the accident provided amusement; from the car in front lept two lads to answer the call to nature - one behind a bus stop, the other an alleyway. moments later, the alleyway boy spotted a nearby bottle shop and dissapeared into it despite the traffic picking up speed. it was so funny to see him running after his mates in the car, shouldering a six-pack.

we went shopping out at erina - i bought [two](http://www.oasisnet.com/) [cds](http://www.deftones.com/) and some [star wars lego](http://www.lego.com/starwars/classic/) (an at-st walker) - yay! actually, that's bad of me, but life is short and there's an awful lot of lego out there, baby. had a relaxed weekend watching 'the wizard of oz' and music videos and pigging out on pasta. although i did manage to suffer a major headache at one point, possibly caused by the ginko in my milkshake. who knows?

i'll get cracking on the rest of the site tomorrow, probably. ah man, it's still nice to be home. while i still have your attention (assuming i ever did in the first place), be sure to check out todd's kinky new design; oh yum!
