summary: I was freaked out by What Lies Beneath.

fuck.

i just watched [what lies beneath](http://www.whatliesbeneath.com/) on video and it *terrified* me. honest to goodness unbridled fear. the spit in my mouth dried up, i have the shakes, and my heart is racing.

oh wait, that could just be the coffee.

regardless, it undid me. i'm pretty hardened when it comes to horror, what with my penchant for stephen king novels and eerie movies, but quasi realistic films like this get to me; it's pretty easy to dismiss a scary monster.

not so a scary husband.
