holy crud it's fucking [hot.](http://au.weather.yahoo.com/148/index_c.html)

i spent three hours up at the hospital this morning. nana is quite lucid and awake, although she's in a lot of pain; two days ago the bones in her right arm caved in, so she had surgery where they implanted sheets of metal and pins to hold her arm together.

from the way mum had described it, i was expecting her to look like a cyborg, but it's not so bad. had good conversation and joked around, so things are looking up; the hospital staff are simply wonderful.

*we only want your rebel soul*
