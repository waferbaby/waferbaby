summary: I think about what's in medicine.

*roxithromycin is highly concentrated in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, achieving intracellular concentrations greater than those outside the cell. roxithromycin enhances the adhesive and chemotactic functions of these cells which in the presence of infection produce phagocytosis and bacterial lysis. roxithromycin also possesses intracellular bactericidal activity.*

it's amazing how little people know about the shit we put into our bodies, particularly when it comes to medicines. i mean, how much of the above did *you* understand? i thought as much.

*although renal clearance of roxithromycin is normally low, accumulation may occur in renal insufficiency.*

yay for renal clearance!

the worst part of it all is that i can't swallow tablets, so i'm forced to chew these. arggggh. there's no way to describe how awful they taste. i imagine it would be akin to swallowing a bucket or two of week-old human waste. yum yum!

sorry. i hope you weren't eating while you read that.
