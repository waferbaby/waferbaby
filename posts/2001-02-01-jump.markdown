summary: I started on a new Pixhell episode and whinged about email replies.
---

i've started working on a new pixhell, and i think there was a bug in my coffee and i just swallowed it. ew.

coffee good.

you know what shits me? when people don't reply to email. be it either a company or a person, if you're advertising your email address freely, then that surely implies you want email and you're going to reply to it?

i'm talking generally here, not about any one specific case. just annoying. 
anyhow, i'm done.

it's already a new month! fuck, time flies (when you're swallowing bugs).
