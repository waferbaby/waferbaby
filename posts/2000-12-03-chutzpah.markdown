surprise!

yeah, you're looking at the new waferbaby (i think this is 
version six of the site, if you're at all curious).

i've taken advantage of a lot of newer cascading style 
sheets stuff, so you'd want to be looking at this in the latest 
browser you can - it renders perfectly for me in netscape 6 
and ie 5 for mac, but your mileage may vary.

the new site isn't all finished yet, but i wanted to post 
it early to let you get used to the new look and get 
feedback on it. i'll link to stuff as i finish it.
