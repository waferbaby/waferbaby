summary: Nana's operation went well.
---

things are looking up.

the operation went fine, and nana is now stable. she was even in high spirits tonight when we went up to visit her; always a good sign. phew, what a long long weekend.

i want to thank ev for keeping me sane and warm; i don't think i'd have coped a second time. she rocks my world, and i oh so love her to itty bitty little marshmallow pieces.

probably vanilla marshmallow.
