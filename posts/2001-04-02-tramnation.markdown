wow. it's already april, and we're moving cities soon, very soon; in nineteen days, in fact! i'm basically packed apart from the computer and its various bits, and my clothes. there's still a lot to be done yet! it's all sooooo exciting.

there's a few hopeful job prospects for me down in melbourne already, so i'm not too worried.
