summary: I order groceries online for the first time, and my interview went well.
---

today marks the first time i've done my grocery shopping [online;](http://www.colesonline.com.au/) yay for having food! (well, it's being delivered tomorrow morning, but whatever).

the good news is my interview went well yesterday. the people are really cool and friendly, and the job is so very me. the bad news is that *if* the position becomes available, it won't be for another month or so. meaning i need to keep busy, and hope.

futon base comes today. [gr.](http://www.fantasticfurniture.com.au/)

i've set myself a few tasks, like redoing the waferbaby frontend and coding some stuff for my [brother.](http://www.segpub.com.au/) i hate being unproductive, if you couldn't tell. speaking of which, i've got to get cracking on a new pixhell series. i'm just waiting for [quicktime 5](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/) for mac os x, first.

amusing: i've been talking to friends from my old workplace, and it turns out they've replaced me with three people. i felt good.

*shopping bags and broken glass 
i hate going through the underpass*
