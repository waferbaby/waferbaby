summary: I wrote about getting air sick.

i'm a shitty traveller.

when it comes to planes, i get airsick. last time i was airborne, i was flying alone to cupertino for job interviews at [apple.](http://www.apple.com/) i remember hitting [lax](http://www.lawa.org/lax/laxframe.html) and having to transfer to a tiny little germ of a plane; a [renoair](http://www.renoair.com/) aircraft.

after fourteen hours of flying from sydney, i was putrid. i was lucky in that i had an empty seat next to mine, so i was able to lie down across the both of them and sleep my way to san francisco (thanks, [pete!](http://www.pete.gontier.org/)).

why am i boring you with my tales of mid-air nausea? because i can? well, yes, but mostly because i've been thinking about planes and travelling, and this little flight we're making to melbourne; so i've dug up info on the plane we're taking: [the boeing 767-300.](http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767-300/product.html)
