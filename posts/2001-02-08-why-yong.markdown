summary: Spent some time with Ev up the coast.
---

i've got a big headache. probably sunstroke.

the coast was really nice, but i wouldn't want to live there. once up there (about one and a half hours out of sydney by train) we drove out to soldier's beach and the entrance, some of ev's old haunts. pretty nice. lots of caravan parks and birds and (no offense to any coasties) [yobbos.](http://www.dictionary.com/cgi-bin/dict.pl?term=yobbo) 
especially those pigmen on the train home, on their way to an [ac/dc](http://www.elektra.com/retro/acdc/) concert. ugh.

me? opinionated? never.

y'know, it feels fucking weird to be in front of a computer. i probably won't be online as much, but you understand. still got lots of stuff to post, but i'm exhausted now. will do it in the morning.

good night out there in waferland.
