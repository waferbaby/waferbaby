summary: I did some research into Nana's feeding tube.
---

i've been doing some reading up for mum about nana, and found [some info:](http://www.umm.edu/digest/glossa-m.htm#e)

*enteral nutrition - way to provide food through a tube placed in the nose, the stomach, or the small intestine. a tube in the nose is called a nasogastric or nasoenteral tube. a tube that goes through the skin into the stomach is called a gastrostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (peg). a tube into the small intestine is called a jejunostomy or percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy (pej) tube. also called tube feeding.*

nana currently has the nasogastric tube, but they're looking to operate in early february to put in a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. the doctor came to talk to mum today, and said that there's a chance nana may never be able to eat again by normal means.

i found a *very* descriptive page describing the whole procedure, and those with weak stomachs (raises hand) may want to avoid [this.](http://www.healthgate.com/sym/surg68.shtml)

i looked into his whole thing further and found that it's quite common to lose the ability to swallow after any sort of neural trauma.

scary.
