I find it hard to write more than 140 characters these days, which is a little sad, innit? Keeping a weblog seems like a bigger challenge than I remember.

I own a Wacom now, a present from Her, so in the very least I'd like to post random drawings here. Eventually. Probably.

Writing does feel kinda good, though. Maybe there _is_ something rattling around up there after all.
