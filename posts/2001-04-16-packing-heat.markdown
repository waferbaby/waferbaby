title: packing heat
summary: I stayed at my brother's.

i'm sitting in the warm early morning sun near the balcony, listening to crows crowing and a plane flying overhead, typing this up on mum's [powerbook,](http://til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n24604) still at my [brother's](http://www.segpub.com.au/) house. ahhh, [adsl.](http://www.bigpond.com/)

we played [monopoly](http://www.monopoly.com/) last night, and i *seriously kicked ass!* yay me. yay.

when i get home i'm going to do the last of the packing, make sure i've got everything, haven't forgotten stuff. then that's it. tomorrow morning they're taking it all away.

five days.

i've been playing with some changes to the front page of the site; a bit of a throwback to older versions, actually, and i will try it out when i get home.

there's no coffee here. ugh. there's instant 'coffee', but i'm a snob.
