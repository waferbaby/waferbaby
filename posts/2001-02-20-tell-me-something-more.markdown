title: tell me something more
summary: I started culling my possessions for the move to Melbourne.
---

i'm going through all my material possessions, in an effort to pack for our move in two months. you know how you accumulate a whole bunch of shit over a span of years? i'm trying to cut it all down to a few boxes.

i've dug up a whole bunch of interesting crap. old drawings. my [barista](http://www.sovrana.com/termin.htm) certificate. skanky aged phone bills. tazos. game instructions. letters. numbers. a whole huge trail of memories that for the most part i can't even remember.

kinda sad, really. but it's time to move on. yeah.
