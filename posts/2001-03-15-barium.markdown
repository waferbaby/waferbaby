summary: Nana slowly started eating solid food again.
---

we're slowly, very very slowly introducing nana onto more solid foods that aren't thickened with a powder as she's been eating, but just mashed with a fork. seems to be going well. her reading is slowly coming back, but she's still having trouble with numbers.

next tuesday she's having another [barium swallow](http://www.adam.com/ency/article/003816.htm), so hopefully the test will show improvements and she can have that glass of water she's so desperate for!
