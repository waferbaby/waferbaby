chloe: you can always tell when ev's been at your place for the weekend. there's like, no new posts on your site ;)

it's true.

today we packed up the remains of my stuff, bought packing tape (and a screw for my chair; i lost one somehow), sealed up all the boxes, and generally got excited. i'm leaving behind my big dinosaur major work from school, but otherwise i'm taking everything.

fired off a bazillion (okay, twelve) emails to real estate agents in the areas we're looking to live, so hopefully i'll hear back from them tomorrow. speaking of tomorrow, i'm meant to get my long-time-coming [camera.](http://www.kodak.com/us/en/digital/cameras/mc3/)

but i won't hold my breath.
