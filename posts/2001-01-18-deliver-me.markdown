i found a gem of a book in our bookcase, nestled tightly amongst the bazillion and one crappy spy novels my dad left behind.

[*singular rebellion*](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0870119893/104-8793988-2779958) was published originally as *tatta hitori no hanran* in japan. it's 1969 (in the book, stupid!), and the story revolves around a "middle-aged ex-career civil servant, having refused to transfer to the ministry of defence on quasi-ideological grounds".

not only does the book look like an excellent read, but it retains the original price sticker from gawd knows how long ago. it's a thick, chunky hardcovered book, 412 pages of musty goodness, and it's original price?

$2.00. vivia la inflation, baby!
