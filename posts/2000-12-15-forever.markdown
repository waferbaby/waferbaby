hot damn that was [good coffee!](http://www.baristas.com.au/)
while i was drinking, this cute lil' two year old boy came up to me and tried to crawl on my lap; he was after my sunnies. too cute!

nana is a lot better today; they even had her walk a few steps - first time in almost a fortnight. this is very good. almost carried on full conversation and everything. was feeling quite hyper and chipper (until i got home).

time to get cracking with the coding, i guess.
