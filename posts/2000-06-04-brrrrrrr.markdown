winter is here. how i hate winter. but enough about me - what's up at the baby for those oh so chilly weeks to come?

i'm keen to get the next issue of **zqn** out - although our editor has gone somewhat awol (come back mike! we love you!). i've snuck a peek at some articles: candy sweeeet.

i've started tooling around with a new **pixhell**. i know it's been a while - sorry. it's just such a pain in the butt to find the time 'cuz of work. same goes for **wacky**. believe it or not, **dao** is really really easy to put together.

keep dem **howtos** and **views** rollin' in! got some ideas germinating. as usual, we'll see. anyhow, i'm rambling. go play.
