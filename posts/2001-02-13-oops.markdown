oops.

the temp work which was meant to take me up to two weeks took about half a day. oh well. i hung out with two cool peeps (dan and ken; there were a total of three daniels in a close proximity to one another) and showed off pixhell. ken showed off some of his sites.

i had lunch at this poshy cafe place around the corner. expensive as hell, so i only had an orange juice and bruschetta (mmm!). the waiter that served me was cool:

*"dining alone sir? what a shame! can i get you a newspaper? alright then! do you want me to help you move your table into the shade? no? alright then!"*

hm. now what do i do for work? anyone have any suggestions?
