i'm posting from my [brother's](http://www.segpub.com.au/) mac.

ev and i went into the city and, after buying me a nice grey t-shirt at [general pants](http://www.generalpants.com.au/), went and had the *nicest* yum cha at [marigolds.](http://sydney.sidewalk.ninemsn.com.au/defaultdetail.asp?id=3667) man, i'm a fucking slob; noodles, soy sauce and rice all over my side of the table while ev's remained pristine and white.

met up with my brother and renae and went to the [apple store](http://www.buzzle.com.au/) on clarence street (same street where i used to work) and had a peek at the new macs and [os x.](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) i was bad and bought [quake 3](http://www.quakearena.com/) (hey, it was cheap!).

tonight we're off to the movies.
