ugh. i've got some sort of headcold. don't ask me how, given this crazy heat, but i do. and mum's hurt her back. we're all in the wars.

so nana came home for an hour yesterday, and it was good. she even walked up the very stairs she fell down, although it totally exhausted her, and she didn't remember anything about it. a good thing.

still finishing off the new little section. and according to the fusion editors, things are sweet; we're going to be suddenly hit with some four or five fusions at once.
