summary: I visited Nana in hospital, and the man in the next bed screamed.
---

eek.

went to visit nana. by the time i got my skinny white butt up there, it was the 'rest period'; 1pm-3pm, strictly no visitors. but i obviously can't read (cough), so i walked along the east wing, meaning to ask where nana was, but spotted her just by chance, sleeping.

she's fine, quite comfortable and all, which rocks. the only problem, actually, is the dude in the next bed. he's this big old greek man who was talking to himself when i arrived; he said something to me but i had no idea what he was saying.

i stayed and talked to nana for about an hour, and during that time the man became more and more agitated until he was screaming and wailing and begging for someone to help him; he needed to go to the toilet but i don't think he could walk, because he kept calling out for the 'big man' to come take him to the bathroom.

ugh.

but the best news is that nana was given some liquid (fruit tea) to drink this morning by the head dietician of the hospital, and she swallowed it without any problems! her first drink in over three months now. she's stoked.
