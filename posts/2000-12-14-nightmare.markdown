i just had a stupid nightmare. i will now try to tell it all in one breath.

*i was living in an apartment and an ex girlfriend lived down the hall and i broke into her apartment and took all my cds back and went back to my room and a neighbour tried to tell me off and then my mum rang to say she'd been stabbed with a needle and it was infected and they'd had to cut off three of her fingers and she was downstairs so i ran downstairs to see her and i fell.*

stupid.

i'm starting this comic project again; i got it all wrong. stupid brain. here's how it's meant to work. i start a panel, then send that to someone and ask them to draw the **next** panel. they send that back to me and i pass it on.
