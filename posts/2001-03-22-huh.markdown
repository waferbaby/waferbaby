title: huh?
summary: I saw The Superjesus and Eskimo Joe in concert.

i'm deaf! well, partially; it's like someone squished wet wads of cotton wool into my ear drums. i guess that's what i get for standing right next to the speakers during a really, really good concert.

[the superjesus](http://www.mono.net/artist/default.asp?id=232) and [eskimo joe](http://www.mono.net/artist/default.asp?id=369) (and palladium, i think it was, who were pretty poor imho); wow! i would have to say that it was the best concert i've yet been to. my neck hurts from snapping my head in time, my throat is numb from screaming (not singing, screaming) along to the music, and my legs are sore from bouncing around, and it's a good thing. superjesus rock my socks.

oh look! some thoughtful soul has made me coffee! oh wait, that was me.
