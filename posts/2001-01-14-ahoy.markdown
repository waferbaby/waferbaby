summary: I went sailing again.
---

i'm sunburnt and exhausted; i spent the day sailing.

i'm terrible with anything other than sweet immobile *terra firma*. dirt? dirt is my friend. last time i went sailing, i was violently sea sick, and vowed to never go again.

i lied.

but i was fine; i went on an empty stomach, so maybe that helped. the water wasn't choppy at all, except for when a few fuckwits going over the speedlimit in their speedboats invoked white-crested wave demons.

don't think i'll be doing it again anytime soon, but it was fun.
