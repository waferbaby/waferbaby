title: sweatshop
summary: Sat talking with Nana, and tinkered with the site again.

that title holds no meaning whatsoever; it's the first thing that popped into my mind, no idea why. and on we go.

sat up with nana for two hours today - mum is back at work - which was cool. we talked about the family; my family is hugeeee. sadly, i don't like most of them.

my new fusion is just waiting on the last panel now. uhm, it's a very *interesting* episode. yes indeedy. but you'll see for yourself, soon enough.

as always, i've been tinkering; you'll notice that input fields, select popups and text areas are a little different; i'm aiming for some sort of an overall look, i guess. hope it's to your liking.

going bowling <del>tonight</del> tomorrow night. haven't seen the nickmeister in ages. (hi nick!)
