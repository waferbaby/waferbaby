title: bye bye
summary: I made my last post before moving to Melbourne.

well, it's all done.

there's a big pile of taped-up boxes in the lounge room downstairs (i ran out of tape, and bought another four rolls just in case).

all that's left now is the imac.

so this is my last post for a while; be good while i'm away! i probably won't be reading my email, so if i don't reply you'll know why. contrary to my previous ideas, i'm not having guest loggers, because it's just *not my bag, baby.*

see you in melbourne!
