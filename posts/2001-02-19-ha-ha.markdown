summary: Ev and I saw some live comedy, and it sucked.

well, we went to see some live comedy tonight, at the bridge hotel in rozelle.

it was fucked.

ugh. racist jokes? puhlease. i didn't laugh, even when ev got called out to the front and the mc (moronic cunt?) asked how long we'd been shagging.

yay for humour - or lack thereof. so ends my first experience with live comedy. tomorrow: daniel battles savage lions escaped from the zoo.
