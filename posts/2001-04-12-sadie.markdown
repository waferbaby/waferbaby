summary: Me, Ev and Mum cleaned our new gross fridge.
---

i'm exhausted and sore, and it's freeeeeeezing. just want to curl up in bed and sleep, but we're going out tonight to a nepalese restaurant tonight for a surprise dinner. should be good, and i'll take the camera. why am i so exhausted and sore?

because we've been cleaning.

the fridge we're taking to melbourne was sooooo fucking grotty; black and green fungus growing in all the grooves, the rubber sealing and any possible surface it could find. yellow grime on the outside and the doors; it used to belong to my step-grandmother, who is a chain smoker.

fucking **gross!**

but it's clean now; between me, ev and mum, we used polish and water and gumption (both like it sounds and this awesome cleaning product) and got it shiny and white again. i also wiped down four chairs and washed out all the drawers, glass and racks from the fridge.

yay! only nine days to go! (quietly blows up from the anticipation)
