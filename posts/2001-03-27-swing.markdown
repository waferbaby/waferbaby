summary: I installed developer tools and didn't book comedy tickets.

now that i'm all set up with software developer tools (yes friends, when 
daniel goes geek, he goes *all the way*), i'm going to start playing around with a few game ideas i've had over the past, uh, for as long as i can remember.

tonight we were going to see some comedy at [the basement,](http://www.thebasement.com.au/) but the fucking ad didn't mention we had to book, and needless to say it's sold out. yay.
