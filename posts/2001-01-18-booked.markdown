speaking of books, my auntie charlotte (who, incidently, lives in melbourne and has made me promise to visit when i'm down there) has published a book: [*rescue and abandonment*](http://www.angusrobertson.com.au/store/featuredbookaus.asp?shopurl=ar&bookid=0908011377&custnum=118200103617641&mediatype=b&bindingtype=bp&cn=ozsearch) is all about jewish people living during the nazi reign, and although a sore spot in my family, is on my list of books to read.
