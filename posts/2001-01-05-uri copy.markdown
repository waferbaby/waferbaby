yeah baby!

thanks to [antonio](http://www.cavedoni.com/) and [ala](http://www.alistapart.com/stories/urls/), i've got the mad [mod_rewrite](http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html) skills happening for urls on the baby now! so instead of "/?name=x", it's going to be simply "/x/"! so much nicer! i'm currently implementing it all over the site.

**nb:** you can still use the old-style "/?name=x/", so any links won't break. cool, eh?
