summary: I tweaked the site's design, again.

if there's such a thing as autumn cleaning, then this is it. i've given the design a bit of a slapping around, and squeezed the backend side of things while i was at it - it ought to be a bit faster. i think. i'll get to the rest of the site eventually.

wet monkeylove to [z](http://www.zeldman.com/) and his homies for their mad css tidbits.
