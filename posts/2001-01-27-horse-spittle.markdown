summary: Visited Nana in the hospital again, and I was a dork.

get it? *horse spittle. hospital.* hahahaha! haha.. hah.. ha.

anyhow.

nana has her arm in a sling, and the arm is plastered from her knuckles all the way to her shoulder - very, very heavy. but she was in very good spirits today, so i wasted no time in teasing her (read: being a total dickhead).

f'instance, because she still can't swallow food, they're feeding her this nutrient solution from a can. there was a can nearby, so i grabbed it and began reading out the 'ingredients':

*"oooh.. chicken livers.. beef.. hydrochloric acid.. and it says it's for puppies two and under! oh boy!"* etc.

so yeah. the old lady in the bed next to nana's was speaking **very loudly** on the phone, and describing how the skin was missing from her (arm?) and you could see all the way to the bone - yum yum. i didn't stay that long.

mmmmm. coffee + peanut butter on toast = orgasmic.

my fusion episode is almost done, as is a second grimm. waferbaby: the website that never sleeps.
