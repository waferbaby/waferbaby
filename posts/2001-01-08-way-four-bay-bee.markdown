[apparantely](http://www.top100.com.au/aust/entertainment/humour/index.html), my site "offers a comic strip titled 'waferbaby', also includes a mailing list and toys."

[this shits me.](http://www.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,1588494%255e421,00.html) every xmas-new years period it's the same story. people get drunk, and drive, and die. as if that's not bad enough, we feel the need to keep a tally, as though it were a competition. i understand it's partly for scare tactics, but it strikes me as stupid.
