*we were sitting on bleachers looking down at the harbour and this concorde flew over followed by three fighter jets and then a fourth jet came along and flew upwards and around and started dropping bombs and everyone ran inside this mountain and someone said it was ok because it was for the british.*

even at twenty four, i still have fucked up nightmares.

had a really good dinner last night; my favourite people, good food, nice weather - it rocked.

got really cool presents, too. the best was the [monkey](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~hert0493/nostalgia/monkey.htm) dvd that ev 
got me. i love this kooky series; even the dubbing. *especially* the dubbing! she also got me the [teenage dirtbag](http://www.wheatus.com/) single (shut up).

my parents got me two hundred and fifty grams of french roast. oh baby. 
[nick](http://trappedin.tvheaven.com/) got me the blade runner dvd, and [jez and renae](http://www.segpub.com.au/) got me a box of [jelly bellys;](http://www.jellybelly.com/) yum! overseas, jesse made me the *coolest* animation (!), [matt](http://a.wholelottanothing.org/) got me the alien 3 dvd and [pete](http://www.pete.gontier.org/) the princess mononoke dvd. you all rock. hard.
