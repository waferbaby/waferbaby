summary: Nana fell down again, and I saw Almost Famous.
---

i was going to make a post about how ev and i saw 'almost famous', and how good it was (it was), but i'm not going to, because nana is back in hospital.

the ambulance came about ten minutes ago: her breathing is laboured, she's somewhat delusional and her leg hurts. she fell down this morning and hit her leg and head again.

they think it's her heart.

i don't know anything anymore. i'm lucky ev is here.
