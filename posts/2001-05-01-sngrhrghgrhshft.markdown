summary: My job interview is re-scheduled because of server difficulties.
---

i'm sitting at [south yarra](http://www.vicnet.net.au/vicnet/region/sthyarra/) station (actually, i was on the wrong platform, but that's not important right now).

i'm sitting at the correct platform, waiting for a train to take me to this job interview. i buy a bottle of water (it's hot). i sit on a seat.

i wait.

three minutes before my train is due, my mobile rings. it's a message from the agency; the client is having some server difficulties (?!); would it be possible to re-schedule the interview for tomorrow?

sure, i say.

sure.

oh well. gnah. and the futon base that was meant to be delivered today (actually, yesterday) wasn't. i'd feel sorry for myself, but i have coffee.
