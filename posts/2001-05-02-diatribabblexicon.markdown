summary: I read No Logo, and give up Vegemite.
---

where yesterday was sunny and full of promise, today is bleak and overcast and weighs down heavily on one's soul.

i think i've become bitter.

i'm reading [no logo](http://www.nologo.org/) (fantastic. i insist you all read it) and it's really giving this sober man pause, to coin (read: mutilate) a phrase.

my poor [vegemite](http://www.vegemite.com.au/), merely a tool to a corporate whore. no more black yeasty goodness for this bitter and sober individual.

on a lighter note, i got the [playstation](http://www.playstation.com.au/) working last night; my [brother](http://www.segpub.com.au/) still has the power cable, and for some reason i had the urge to play with it. using nothing but blind luck and my pocket knife, i managed to wittle this old cable from an electric shaver and make it fit into the playstation.
