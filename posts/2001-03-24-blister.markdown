nuts.

both [broadway](http://sydney.sidewalk.ninemsn.com.au/defaultdetail.asp?id=19363) and [fox studios](http://www.foxstudios.com.au/) were sold out; what a travesty! ah well. we played arcade games instead, and i managed to incur a blister on my thumb from going apeshit over [x-men vs. street fighter.](http://gamesarea.ucdavis.edu/x_vs_sf.html) i have to boast and say i got up to apocalypse on just one credit. hah!

so yeah, that was my weekend so far. how's yours?
