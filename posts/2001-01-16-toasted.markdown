summary: I found out the CD burner I'd bought was DOA.

doa. that stands for *dead on arrival*. which, according to [lacie](http://www.lacie.com/), is what my burner is. yay.

i'm getting another sent out tomorrow. oh the trials and tribulations of working in this industry! sometimes i wonder why i bother.

new stuff coming soon. and do you realise it's almost february? **yay!**

i'm currently re-reading [*"a fortunate life"*](http://www.bookworm.com.au/p100809.htm), a book i was originally forced to read at school and have since fallen for in a big way. it's on my list of books i re-read every year or two (along with the lord of the rings, the hobbit etc.). it's about a man growing up in early australia, and the trials he suffered. i love it.
