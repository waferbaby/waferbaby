summary: I edited the database by hand, and waited for my MC3 to arrive.

a sudden hailstorm popped out of nowhere and flooded the balcony, pelting my window with irregular ice cubes from the clouds. crazy, baby.

i'm reworking a lot of the database (by hand; amazingly tedious), so if you see weird things going on, don't freak out.

my [mc3](http://www.kodak.com/us/en/digital/cameras/mc3/) is meant to arrive tomorrow. it's been delayed by some three weeks or so, and during that time the price has dropped by about sixty dollars (aud). luckily, [they're](http://www.estore.com.au/) reimbursing me the difference.

doesn't commerce just give you a warm inner glow?
