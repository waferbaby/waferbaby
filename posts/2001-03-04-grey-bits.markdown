title: grey bits
summary: I rebuilt the site (again).

this is the new waferbaby (well, the front page, in the very least). the rest is coming eventually.

yes, it's grey. oh well. i'll be adding the prefs again soon so you can fuck around with whatever colours you like, but i'm a bit sick of the whole blue look right now, and wanted a change.

and here it is.
