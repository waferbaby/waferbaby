title: eagle one
summary: I was freaked out by fighter jets flying low overhead.

so i'm just sitting here, as you do, doing my thing, when all of a sudden there's this tremendous tearing sound. it takes a few seconds for me to recognise it as the sonic boom created by the fighter jet or jets that have decided to go mental and fly low over my suburb.

now if it had happened just once, it may not have been anything to write home about. but i swear the plane or planes came back and forward and, when i caught a glimpse of one, up and down, some seven or eight times! i went out on the street and stood gaping along with everyone else at the sky.

bizarre. hopefully this will pop up in the news and i'll know what the whole deal is.
