one of the two projects i've mentioned is well underway, and i'm currently coding up crap for the second one.

let me tell you a bit about the first: it's a collaborative effort - a comic. i start a panel, then pick a name from a list, and fire it off in an email. the person in question adds something to the panel - whatever they like, no rules other than not resizing the image and leaving it as a gif file - and sends it back to me. repeat! if you'd like to be involved, let me know.

the second i'll tell you a bit more about when there's something to tell.
