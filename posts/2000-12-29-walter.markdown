summary: I ordered some RAM and someone confused my name.
---

so i'd ordered some more ram for the imac (for a total of 256mb), and while making the order i'd put "waferbaby" as the company - as you do. the ram arrived today; i'm sitting around and the doorbell buzzes:

i answer: "hello?". a voice on the other end comes back to me.

"uh yeah, i've got a package for a walter baby?".

that's me. walter baby.
