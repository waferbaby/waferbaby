summary: We had a dinner for my step-grandmother's birthday, and I started writing Objective-C.

we had a nice dinner tonight; both for [pesach](http://www.holidays.net/passover/) and my step-grandmother lil's birthday. the whole family was there, eating and being merry, telling stories about war and the great depression (it just came up, ok?), with plenty of tomfoolery thrown in for good measure.

gotta love the tomfoolery. actually i just like saying that word. tomfoolery.

in other far far less interesting news, i've started working on that little game of mine; objective-c is way cool. ok, 'nuff about that.

official melbourne countdownâ„¢: today, two weeks. keeeeeeen.
