mmm. almost nothing nicer than sucking down butterfly pasta drowned in [paul newman's own pasta sauce](http://www.newmansown.com/products/pasta_sauce/default.html) (the tomato and basil one is my favourite, although it's not listed on the site) while reading the latest [table](http://www.coles.com.au/hotspots/oz_table.htm) mag. ahhhhhhh.

oh yeah, and i finished the artwork for the new pixhell, but kurt is still awol in asia somewhere or other. hurry back, you tall gothboy!
