summary: I went to dinner with the family and installed the OS X beta.

last night i went to dinner with jez and renae, my genetic father and his partner. whee. she works for nestle', so i scored a [milo](http://www.nestle.com.au/sites/milo/) t-shirt (always stylish, that's me.).

i'm making this post from [os x](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) beta. i've installed it partly to get used to when the final version gets here in ten days, and partly because, well, i'm just a teenage dirtbag (baby).

there's about thirty seven days to go before we leave for melbourne (not that i'm counting or anything).
