title: day one
summary: I went and saw the fireworks at Darling Harbour.

while wholy opposed to them, i have to admit that up close, the [fireworks](http://www.newyearseve.com.au/) were something else; there was a magical quality to those stupidly colourful and ultimately deafening explosions, as though [gandalf](http://www.lordoftherings.net/) himself had woven them.

maybe it was just all that happy, drunken energy of [the crowd](http://www.darlingharbour.com.au/). regardless, i had a really really good night.
