summary: I decided I need a haircut.
---

i think it's time for a haircut, although it's getting into the colder seasons and you'd think it would be clever to keep it put. but! annoyingly, there's this big tuft of hair on the left side of my head that refuses to be tamed. damn that tuft. damn it all to hell.

*lick my legs and i'm on fire 
lick my legs and i'm desire.*

- rid of me, pj harvey.
