oh, did i say waferbaby was finished? it's never **really** finished; just sort of *stable*, if you like. what am i babbling about? i'm bringing back a new and improved version of hummer and redone themes soon, in case you were wondering where they all went.

otherwise? feelin' kinda blue and bummed out for no particular reason. go figure.
