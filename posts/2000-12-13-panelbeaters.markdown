wow.

i've been swamped with people wanting to be involved in this comic project - rock on! keep those emails coming, because secretly i want to make this the biggest comic in the known universe. maybe. but don't tell anyone.

it is stinking, unbearably muggy today. i hate summer. i think i'll like melbourne.

off to do some shopping and then visit nana. they've moved her out of intensive care and removed the tubes for a second time, and even had her sitting in a chair (!) for two hours yesterday. things are looking up!
