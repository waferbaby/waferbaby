title: chaos
summary: There was a traffic accident outside my house.

ouch.

a big accident outside; a van and a bus full of people, right in the middle of two busy main roads. looks like no one was hurt though (phew). traffic slowed to a crawl, until another clever bus driver tried to work around the accident and got stuck, thus blocking traffic on all sides.

add to that the two ambulances and the tow truck and you have total chaos. it's clearing up now, however.

the fun never stops.
