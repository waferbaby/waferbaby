summary: Ev and I had a nice weekend up the coast.
---

we had a nice weekend! went to the beach; first time i'd been in fucking ages! being the woosy bastard i am, i thought it would be way too cold since it was windy and the sun had set; but in the end i bit the bullet and much fun and swimming and bodysurfing and splashing/swallowing of water ensued!

also went to a 21st. whee.

and i spent way too much money i didn't have on cds i'd wanted for a while. ah, life's annoying little guilty pleasures; sue me.

didn't end up going to [tropfest;](http://www.tropfest.com.au/) it started raining, and then we found better things to do.
