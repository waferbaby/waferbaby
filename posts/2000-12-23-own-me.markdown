summary: Added more preferences to the site, played Oni.
---

i've been touching up bits and pieces of the site; you'll notice that the panels on either side of you have melded together. i'm much happier with how they look now. also i've added a new preference for news posts; you can configure how many are shown per go, ordered by date (obviously, no?). i'm still fiddling with the news even now; need to add archives, etc.

let me just say that [oni](http://oni.bungie.com/) is *fucking awesome*. if i vanish for a few months, you'll konoko why. er, know.
