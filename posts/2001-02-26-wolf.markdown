summary: Nana's feeding tube came out.
---

nana's feeding tube came out today, and they've started to feed her food; mushed up, baby-like food, but food all the same. assuming all goes according to plan, she comes home this week. i'll be looking after her from now until we fly to melbourne, so i'll probably be away from the computer a fair bit (hah! yeah right).

which reminds me: if anyone knows of any cool freelance work i can do from home in the interim, let me know.
