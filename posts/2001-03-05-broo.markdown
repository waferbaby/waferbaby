title: broo
summary: I started rolling features back into the site.
---

both brainstorm and prefs are back. i've totally changed the way prefs work: you've now got access to the site's whole stylesheet, and since the entire site pivots off of that, you've got the drivers seat, baby.

i'll be adding themes real soon, too. anyone want a theme based on their site? let me know.
