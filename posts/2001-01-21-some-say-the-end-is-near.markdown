summary: The family went to visit Nana in rehab.
---

someone had to go and drink five really strong coffees today, didn't they? smart daniel. clever daniel. insomniac daniel.

my whole immediate family (mum+stepdad+stepgrandmother+brother+brother's gf) went out to little bay to visit nana in rehab. she's looking like her old self again - when we arrived she was sitting outside with mum, wearing normal clothes. admittedly she was in a wheelchair, which she normally isn't. but she's walking almost normally again.

it's good. really good.

so is the second of february. very good. *very* good. the best kind of good. very bestly muchly goodly good.

we had breakfast in newtown this morning (mmm, coffee and chunky raisin toast, oh baby), and on the way we passed a [toolshed](http://www.toolshed.com.au/) store - and there was a huuuuugeee crowd outside lined up. taking up the entire footpath for a whole block.

anyone know what that was all about?
