me: i'm going to look up some removalists. 
nana: why don't you use the (phone) book? 
me: ah, i can just look online. on the computer. 
nana: you use the computer for everything, don't you? 
me: yeah! my whole life revolves around it.

sad but true. sad but true.

today is raisin toast day! well actually, every tuesday and thursday is raisin toast day, 'cuz that's when the little corner shop opposite gets it in. and it seems as though i'm the only one who buys it.

the ladies that run that shop have been there forever; we used to live in this same street, further down, about fourteen years ago, and they were there then, and i'd swear they hadn't aged! they're kinda weird, but it's hard to explain without seeing for yourself. they're very nice though.

and they have *raisin toast!*
