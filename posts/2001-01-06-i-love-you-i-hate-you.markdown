i'm sorry, but i've found a new love.

don't take it personally. i had a blast while i was with you; you kept me perky and wide awake, and you tasted oh so good. but it's time to move on. someone else will love you; in fact, they already do, and always did. this is the best for both of us.

i'm changing to [vittoria coffee](http://www.vittoriacoffee.com/).
