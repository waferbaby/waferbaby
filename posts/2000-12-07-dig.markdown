summary: I followed up on Nana's condition.
---

have three days really passed? it feels more like months. years. when something like this happens, time seems to stretch on like some relentless, stubborn taffy.

i don't know how to thank you all for your kind words both in email and on dreamless; we're all overwhelmed. thank you, thank you, thank you.

nana has improved somewhat; they've removed the tubes from her stomach and lungs, and she seems to be breathing on her own, although they're carefully watching her in case of a relapse. the doctors are amazed; they now seem to think there will be no damage to her brain, and today she started speaking again; she's not 100% with it, but you'd expect that.

i'm trying to keep busy, so i'm working on the waferbaby backend crap.
