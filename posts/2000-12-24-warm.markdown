title: warm
summary: I had a good day and added pagination to the archives.

it's one of those warm summery days where you can get sunburnt from being outside for a mere five minutes, if not less. the cat is in a playful mood, the coffee is on, toast is-a burning, and i'm yet to hear a single xmas carol.

life should be this good every day.

i've added a news post 'controller' to the bottom of this page, should you want to walk through previous news. the archives are still forthcoming, although there's little news to dig through yet, and why'd you bother in the first place is beyond me.
