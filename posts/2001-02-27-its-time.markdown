title: it's time
summary: I joined the Browser Upgrade campaign.
---

i'm tired of writing code to support stupid browsers with pathetic attempts at standards compliance, so i'm not doing it anymore. waferbaby has happily joined up with the [browser upgrade](http://www.webstandards.org/upgrade/) campaign. you may or may not agree with this; if you want to live in the stone age, that's up to you, baby!

time to move on, people.

wow; i wrote all that without my first coffee of the day! are you impressed yet? i sure as hell was. almost finished a new fusion, and kurt promises that the audio for the new pixhell will be done this week.
