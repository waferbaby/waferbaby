summary: Ev and I went for a big walk.
---

we did a whole lot of walking yesterday; in fact, i'm pretty sure we walked for the entire day!

where did we start? imagine you can hear the sounds of my brain ticking over right now, because i'm trying to remember. oh yeah! the city. poked around in [redeye.](http://www.redeye.com.au/) walked from there up to the [art gallery](http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/), which was swarmed with annoying school kids due to bloody [art express.](http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/exhibitions/index.php4?e=80) who the fuck picks the colours for school uniforms anyhow? this one girls' school wore a nasty shade of *pink.* ewwww.

i don't know why, but i was grumpy yesterday.

the gallery was pretty dissapointing actually. boring. yawn. so we left, and walked along through [hyde park.](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/ci_hyde_park_north.asp) they've converted an old toilet block into a really nice looking cafe. we nabbed a cappucino and a banana muffin (soooooo goood!) from there. then went shopping for an alarm clock for ev.

let me just say, both [david jones](http://www.davidjones.com.au/) and [grace bros](http://www.gracebros.com.au/) have dissapointing toy departments.

what next? we walked down to [the rocks,](http://www.rocksvillage.com/index.cfm) home of the [infamous](http://www.rockpool.com.au/) rockpool restaurant ($45 for a main meal! $30 for an entree!) and the [museum of contemporary art,](http://www.mca.com.au/) which we had a breeze through - nice photography exhibition on right now, and it's free (thanks, [telstra](http://www.telstra.com/)).

then we walked across the [harbour bridge](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/hs_hb_sydney_harbour_bridge.asp) (well, half way, 'cuz i'm afraid of heights), and climbed up 3/4 of the way into the southern pylon; we could have gone to the top for a great view, but it costs and we're broke.

then we went and met up with ev's friends and went to a pub in the rocks. 
then we went home.
