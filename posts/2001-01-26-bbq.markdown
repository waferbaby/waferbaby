about to leave for a lil' family bbq at my [brother's](http://www.segpub.com.au/). i'll be eating lots of salad, i think. mum's potato salad kicks several unique forms of *ass.* yay for ass-kicking spuds!

nana's operation was a success. her right arm is bandaged from wrist to shoulder and strapped to the ceiling, mum tells me. i'll be popping in on her sometime tomorrow.

mmmm s<u>ev</u>en days.
