i can deal with mcdonalds (ignore it). i can deal with starbucks (ignore it). but this is just fucking stupid:

"the fast-food chain taco bell claims to have used a barge to tow a "mir target" - measuring about 100 square metres and inscribed with purple lettering saying free taco here - off the australian coast. if a piece of mir "rings taco's bell", the company will give free tacos to all 281 million americans." from [smh page one.](http://www.smh.com.au/news/0103/23/pageone/pageone4.html)

in other, much happier news, nana comes home today! of course, her hip isn't healed yet and she's not 100% healthy, but at least she's coming home.
