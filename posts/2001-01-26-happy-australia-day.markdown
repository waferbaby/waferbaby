a little bit of [history](http://www.australiaday.com.au/history.html) for you, plus an [overview](http://www.news.com.au/common/indepth/0,4811,australiaday%255eaustralia%2bday%255etext,00.html) of the day's events.

nana is having an operation on her arm today to remove the pins holding the bones in place - they've knitted together - so hopefully all goes well.
