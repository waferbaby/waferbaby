title: sorrow
summary: Nana had her accident on the stairs.
---

my heart is oh so heavy with grief tonight. i am sore from crying, and both physically and mentally exhausted.

this morning, my grandmother flew down from brisbane, to attend a cousin's funeral. tonight, she lies in a stable but critical condition in the local hospital, unconscious, doped up on morphine, with broken bones and possible brain damage.

she fell down the stairs, not two hours after she'd been here. not two fucking hours.

i'm going to be spending a lot of time up at the hospital, so i hope you'll forgive me for not posting very often. everyone has been so great, so thoughtful and caring, and i especially want to thank jeffrey, ev, peta and kurt for their support. i love you all. thank you.
