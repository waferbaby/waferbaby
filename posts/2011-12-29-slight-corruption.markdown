America had (subtly) corrupted me decades and decades before I'd ever lived here.

As a gawky, anti-social pre-teen I hung out with a group of gawky, anti-social pre-teens at primary school, and we spent an awful lot of time playing role-playing games, both socially and at school. Ones published in America. Advanced Dungeons and Dragons - [2nd edition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Advanced_Dungeons_.26_Dragons_2nd_edition "The Wikipedia entry for AD&D 2nd Edition.") - and many from the Palladium stable (especially the [TMNT one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_%26_Other_Strangeness "The Wikipedia entry for the TMNT RPG.") and its add-ons).

My characters were always such and such *feet* tall, and weighed xyz *pounds*. Feet. Pounds. I grew up ignoring the Metric system, and still don't really have a good grasp of it.

But hey, I know I'm almost six feet tall.

Even today, living in San Francisco - on a street that smells so strongly of pot - I sometimes find myself almost getting into the wrong side of a car. Crossing the road has, thankfully, stopped being an issue. I've started to forget which used to be the 'correct' way to say or spell some things, though, which is a little terrifying.

Colour. Favour. Arvo. Biscuit.

I **do** like living here, though. Quite a bit.
