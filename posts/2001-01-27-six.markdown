i really do keep stupid hours. ugh.

last night i ended up having reallllly nice miso soup (oh! udon noodles! oh!) and vegetable tempura from the japanese place across the road. mmm.

i don't have anything interesting to say right now, because i am severely caffiene deprived. i'm sure i'll be back later.
