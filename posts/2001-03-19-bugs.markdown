summary: I watched Alien 3 and got creeped out.
---

so i'm sitting here, watching [alien 3](http://www.foxhome.com/alienlegacy/html/alien3/alien3_frames.html) just after midnight (as you do). the house is dead quiet, there are no lights on, and the movie works its magic on me.

i'm authentically creeped out.

i turn on the light for a toilet break and there's this big-arsed cockroach crawling all over my desk, and i swear it looked like an alien for about three seconds, so i pull an ellen ripley and blast that motherfucker right out of the damn airlock.

ok, so i squashed it.
