Here are some of the animations I've made over the years.

### Pixhell

> In a far away place exists a pocket of a world where tiny creatures draw out their inexplicably troubled lives. These are their stories.

I built these tiny animations using a hacked [CICN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork#Major_resource_types "The Wikipedia entry for resource forks.") editor in [ResEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit "The Wikipedia entry for ResEdit.") (oh, I know). I'd draw each frame pixel by pixel, carefully take a screenshot and paste it into an animated GIF editor.

When all the frames were done - and an episode could take up to *sixty hours* - I'd convert the GIF into a QuickTime movie and send it over to my pal Kurt, who would create the sound effects to match. Once I had his audio track I'd glue the two together and foist the episode onto the Interwebs.

I've kept the painful descriptions intact.

#### Series 1

> There is no obvious plot for series one. Suffice to say there is alien abduction, cyborg technology, sex and violence, scorpion mutilation, big guns, secret romance, a wedding, demons and undead rabbits, a big battle, spectral figures and the cutest little sheep on two pixels.

#### General

> General episodes of Pixhell are lone wolves that don't belong in any one series. These are the rogues - the experiments, the episodes that didn't quite cut it for linear consumption. Enjoy the offcuts!
