## Animations

I'd always wanted to be an animator when I grew up. Neither happened.

### Pixhell

This was a pixel animation series with a terribly hard-to-find plot that I'd regularly post on waferbaby (and for a while there, its own website).

> In a far away place exists a pocket of a world where tiny creatures draw out their inexplicably troubled lives. These are their stories.

I built these tiny animations using a hacked [CICN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork#Major_resource_types "The Wikipedia entry for resource forks.") editor in [ResEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit "The Wikipedia entry for ResEdit.") (Really). I'd draw each frame pixel by pixel, carefully take a screenshot and paste it into an animated GIF editor. When all the frames were done - and an episode could take up to *sixty hours* - I'd convert the GIF into a QuickTime movie and send it over to my pal Kurt, who would create the sound effects to match. Once I had his audio track I'd glue the two together and post the episode.

I've kept the (painful) descriptions intact here.

#### Series 1

> There is no obvious plot for series one. Suffice to say there is alien abduction, cyborg technology, sex and violence, scorpion mutilation, big guns, secret romance, a wedding, demons and undead rabbits, a big battle, spectral figures and the cutest little sheep on two pixels.

#### General

> General episodes of Pixhell are lone wolves that don't belong in any one series. These are the rogues - the experiments, the episodes that didn't quite cut it for linear consumption. Enjoy the offcuts!
