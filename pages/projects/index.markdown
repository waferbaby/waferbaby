Here are some of the web-based projects I've worked on. Sorry about that.

### The Setup
[https://usesthis.com/](https://usesthis.com/ "My nerdy interview site.")

Twice a week (every Tuesday and Thursday), I interview people from all over about the software and hardware they use and their ideal dream setup. The site is built with my own dumb little [Ruby-based static site generator](http://github.com/waferbaby/dimples "My static site generator gem.").

### Fax.ink
[http://fax.ink/](http://fax.ink/ "The art project for YACHT.")

This was a fun project to promote [YACHT](http://teamyacht.com/ "YACHT's website.")'s new album, where we faxed a limit run of the cover and a manifesto to the first 300 people that signed up. It's a very simple Rails app designed as an API that talks to [Matthew](https://matthewspencer.me/ "Matthew's website.")'s frontend magic.
