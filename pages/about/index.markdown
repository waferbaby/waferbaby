Oh look, another about page.

Hi! I'm Daniel Bogan, a sarcastic self-deprecating asthmatic vegan web developer from Sydney, living in San Francisco with my wife, our son and four small dogs.

Yes, that's really [my last name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan "The Wikipedia entry for Bogan.").

I'm an [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API.") [developer](http://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account.") at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com "Awesome customer support software."), which is awesome. Before that I worked on Flickr's API team for almost 500 years. I've been doing this whole web thing since the mid 90's - originally I wanted to be an animator (and "waferbaby" was going to be my studio name, obviously), but I accidently fell online instead.

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.
