## About

Hello! I'm Daniel Bogan, a human from Sydney, Australia. I live with my wife and our four tiny, scrappy dogs (Max, Oscar, Finch, Rosie) in San Francisco.

I work at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/ "Awesome customer support software.") as a [software engineer](http://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account."), hacking on the [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API."). Before that, I worked at Flickr for almost eight years.

I also run [The Setup](http://usesthis.com/ "Seriously. A nerdy interview site."), a nerdy interview site. Sorry about that.

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.
