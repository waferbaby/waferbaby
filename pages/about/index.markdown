Oh look, another about page.

Hi there! I'm Daniel, a sarcastic self-deprecating asthmatic vegan web developer from Sydney, living in San Francisco with my wife and our four small dogs.

I'm an [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API.") [developer](http://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account.") at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com "Awesome customer support software."), which is awesome. Previously I worked at Flickr (for almost 500 years). I've been doing this whole web thing since the mid 90's - sorry about that.

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.
