## ✋

Hello! I'm Daniel, a self-deprecating 👦 from 🇦🇺.

I live with my 👩 and our four small 🐶 in 🌁, where I work as an [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API.") [engineer](http://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account.") at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/ "Awesome customer support software."). Previous, I was a developer at Flickr for almost 500 years.

I also run [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/ "A nerdy interview site."), a nerdy interview site. Sorry about that.

Once upon a 🕓 I made [pixel animations](/animations/ "My pixel animations."). Sorry about *that*.

You can 📧 me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.
