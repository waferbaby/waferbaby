## ✋

Hello! I'm Daniel, a self-deprecating human from Sydney, Australia.

I live with my wife and our four small dogs in San Francisco, where I work as an [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API.") [engineer](http://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account.") at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com "Awesome customer support software."). Previously I worked at Flickr for almost 500 years.

I run [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/ "A nerdy interview site."), a nerdy interview site, and contribute to [CASH Music](http://cashmusic.org/ "A non-profit music platform."), a non-profit music platform. Sorry about that.

Once upon a time I made [pixel animations](/animations/ "My pixel animations."). Sorry about *that*.

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.

❤️
