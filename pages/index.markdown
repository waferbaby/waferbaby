I'm a sarcastic, asthmatic vegetarian web developer from Sydney, now living in Melbourne with my wife and son.

Yeeeeeeeeeeeep, that's really [my last name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan "The Wikipedia entry for Bogan."). I know.

I run [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/ "A nerdy interview site."), a nerdy website where I interview people about what they use to get the job done. I work at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com "Awesome customer support software.") as an [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API.") [developer](https://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account."), and hack on [CASH Music](http://cashmusic.org/ "Open-source music tools.") in my spare time. Before that, I worked on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/ "A photo sharing website.")'s API team for almost a decade - sorry about that.

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.
