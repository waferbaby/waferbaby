## Hello!

I'm Daniel, a self-deprecating human from Sydney, Australia.

I live with my wife and our four small dogs in San Francisco, where I work as an [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API.") [engineer](http://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account.") at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com "Awesome customer support software."). Previously I worked at Flickr for almost 500 years.

I run [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/ "A nerdy interview site."), a nerdy interview site, and contribute to [CASH Music](http://cashmusic.org/ "A non-profit music platform."), an awesome non-profit music platform. Sorry about that.

I've been a vegan since 2001, but I don't like to make a big deal about it. You do you.

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.

❤️
