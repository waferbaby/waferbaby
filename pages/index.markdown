Hi there! I'm Daniel Bogan.

I'm a sarcastic, self-deprecating asthmatic vegan web developer from Sydney, living in San Francisco with my wife, our son and three small dogs.

Yes, that's *really* [my last name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan "The Wikipedia entry for Bogan.").

I run [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/ "A nerdy interview site."), a nerdy interview website where I ask people what they use to get the job done. I'm also an [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API.") [developer](http://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account.") at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com "Awesome customer support software."), and hack on [CASH Music](http://cashmusic.org/ "Open-source music tools.") on the side. I used to work on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/ "A photo sharing website.")'s API team for almost a decade before that - I like APIs.

I've been doing this whole web thing since the mid 90's - I originally wanted to be an [animator](/animations/ "My old animations."), but I accidently stumbled onto this whole Internet thing as a career instead.

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.
