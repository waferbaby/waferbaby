Hello! I'm a self-deprecating human being from Sydney, Australia. I live with my wife and our four small dogs in [sunny/cold/foggy] San Francisco.

I work at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/ "Awesome customer support software.") as an [API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api "The Zendesk API.") [engineer](http://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account."). Previously I was at Flickr for roughly 500 years.

I also run [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/ "A nerdy interview site."), a nerdy interview site. Sorry about that.

Once upon a time I made [pixel animations](/animations/ "My pixel animations."). Sorry about *that*.

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.
