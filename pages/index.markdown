## About 

Hello! I'm Daniel Bogan, a web developer from Sydney now living in Melbourne with my wife, our two kids, and a very lazy chihuahua.

Yes, that's really [my last name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan "The Wikipedia entry for Bogan."). I know.

I run [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/ "A nerdy interview site."), a nerdy website where I interview people about what they use to get the job done. I work as a [developer](https://github.com/waferbaby/ "My GitHub account.") at [Buildkite](http://www.buildkite.com/ "Tools to help developers test and publish their code.").

You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.
