<h2>About</h2>

<p>Hello! I'm Daniel Bogan, a web developer who lives in Melbourne with my wife, our two kids, and a very lazy chihuahua.</p>
<p>Yes, that's really <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan" alt="The Wikipedia entry for Bogan.">my last name</a>. I know.
<p>I run <a href="https://usesthis.com/" alt="A nerdy interview site.">Uses This</a>, a nerdy website where I interview people about what they use to get the job done.</p>
<p>You can email me by sending something to the fourth letter of the English alphabet, followed by the 'at' symbol, care of this domain.</p>
